# Computational Intelligence Coursework

The task of this coursework was to implement a series of evolutionary operators into a skeleton of an evolutionary algorithm. Once this was compleated we then had to plan and conduct a series of experiments to test out our operators.

### Aims:
* Understand and implement a range of evolutionary operators (selection, crossover, replacement, mutation)
* Improve skills based around using libraries created by other people
* Improve java skills
